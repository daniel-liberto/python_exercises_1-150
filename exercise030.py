# My answer
baseTriangle = int(input('What is the base area from the triangle? '))
heightTriangle = int(input('What is the height of the triangle? '))

print(f'The triangle area is: {(baseTriangle * heightTriangle / 2)}')

print()

# Solution
b = int(input("Input the base : "))
h = int(input("Input the height : "))

area = b*h/2

print("area = ", area)
